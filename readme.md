# `bogdan.guna.me`

This is a simple web application to present my recent work.

It has a profile sidebar, `about` section and a `contact` form to get in touch.

### Future Work

* add authentication
* add ability to view/handle contact messages in the browser (requires auth)
* add a `projects` section where my recent work will be summarised
* add insight (commits, build version, etc.) into profile sidebar
* dockerise the application

### Components

* [client](client/)
